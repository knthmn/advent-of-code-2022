# Advent of Code 2022

[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) problems in Python. 
The code is all over the place as I was only trying to solve the problem.
I might clean it up if I have the time and the mood.
There are also some problems I would like to find a faster solution.

Some notes on the solutions
- Day 11: I decided not to use `eval`, kind of feels like cheating.
- Day 19: The method I used for taming the number of states uses magic number.
  I cannot guarantee it works with every input, and it shouldn't be there at the first place (it is probably compensating for some bad reasoning on my part). 
- Day 21: I could have used `sympy` and might rewrite it later doing so.
- Day 22: The solution requires manually finding all the corresponding sides.
  I might try to figure out how to do it with code.
